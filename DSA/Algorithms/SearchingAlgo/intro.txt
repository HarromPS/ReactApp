There are different searching algorithms to search an element from array 
linked list, graphs, strings, etc.
1) Linear Search 
==> Searches an element in an array linearly 
O(n) time complexity.

2) Binary Search
==> Search an element on an interval
==> Binary Search is performed on Sorted elements
O(log n) time complexity

3) Jump Search 
==> Searches an element in an interval of a factor of the indexes.
O(n (log n)) time complexity
