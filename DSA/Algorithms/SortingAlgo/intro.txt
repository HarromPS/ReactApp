Sorting Algorithm - process to place elements in increasing(ascending)
or decreasing (descending) order.
A procedure that sorts elements in minimum time with effencicy & with 
ease is called Sorting Algorithm.
==> Analysis Criteria
1) Time complexity - how less time taken for large inputs.
2) Space Complexity - how less memory is consumed by the algo.
    In-place algo- taking constant time.
3) Stability - Retaining the order of the same elements after sorting.
4) Internal/External Sorting Algo- 
    Internal= Loads all the data into the memory(RAM).
    External= do not Loads all data in memory, takes data from 
    disk, hard drive, databases,etc.
5) Adaptive - for already sorted algorithm it takes less time & provides
relatively some advantages. 
5) Recursive/Non-Recursive - if algo uses recursion = Recursive
if not uses recursion = Non-Recursive.
