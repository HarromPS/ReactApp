The useful classes for working with files in C++ are
1) fstreambase class
2) ifstream class   --> Derived from fstreambase class
3) ofstream class   --> Derived from fstreambase class

In order to work with with files in C++, you will have to open it.
Primarily there are 2 ways to open the file:
1) Constructor
2) Using the memeber function open() of the class
