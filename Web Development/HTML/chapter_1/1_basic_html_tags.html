    <!-- HTML elements have attributes that will provide additional information about that particular element. It takes 2 parameters, ie, a name & a value which define the properties of the element and are placed inside the element tag.

    <element attribute_name="attribute_value">

The name parameter takes the name of the property we would like to assign to the element and the value takes the properties value or extent of the property names that can be aligned over the element. Every name has some value that must be written within quotes. -->
